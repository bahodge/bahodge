## About

Hey, I'm Ben and I'm a Senior Web Developer. I'm super into programming languages, design patterns and software architecture! I am a compulsive learner and this is where I store all the random stuff I learned. I generally don't use Github all that often except for my personal projects or moonlighting contracts which are generally all private repositories. I'm married and have a great rescue pup named Sardine (Sardy).

## Work Tech

My current work stack is pretty fun because I get to touch everything from the cloud to the edge device. I'm not going to include all of them because I think the list is big already. At my core, I would say I'm a NodeJS developer and can say I've gotten to actually use some of the advanced features of the language.

- Typescript
- React + Vite
- Graphql & REST
- MongoDB,PostgreSQL & Redis
- Kubernetes, Docker & Docker Compose
- Elastic w/ Kibana (ELK)
- Robot Operating System (ROS)
- GCP & AWS
- GitLab CI/CD +

## Personal Tech

I pretty much have started writing all of my personal projects in either Go or some other weird language. Given that, I continously am learning new tech.
