## About

My name is Ben and I'm a web developer. I'm super into programming languages, design patterns and software architecture! I am a compulsive learner and this is where I store all the random stuff I learned.

So, I generally don't use Github all that often except for my personal projects or moonlighting contracts which are generally all private repositories. So please enjoy looking at my public repo source code but know that I probably just hacked it together in an hour or so. If activity is important to you, then check out my [GitLab contributor graph](https://gitlab.com/benhodge_plusone). I kind of don't care about frontend & design stuff and tend to focus more on the backend.

I'm the Group Lead for the Cloud team at an international industrial robotics software company. It is a cool position where I am half people manager and half software architect. I specificially work with connecting humans and robots through the internet and get to play with a bunch of facinating technologies to accomplish this. I get to collaborate with some really world class engineers and people who are all super passionate about their jobs. I've gotten to play with a robots, distributed computing, realtime communications, scaling infrastructure and even went to a few client sites. If this sounds cool to you, see [plus one robotics](https://plusonerobotics.com/) to learn more.

## Tech

My current work stack is pretty fun because I get to touch everything from the cloud to the edge device. I'm not going to include all of them because I think the list is big already. At my core, I would say I'm a NodeJS developer and can say I've gotten to actually use some of the advanced features of the language.

Node + Typescript, React, Graphql, React, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, RxJs, Robot Operating System (ROS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS) & GitLab. There are many more technologies I use, but these are some of the main ones.

## Languages

Like I wrote earlier, I love learning new programming languages. Ruby is my favorite language to develop in by far for one simple reason, it's easy to write. Anyways, here are some cool languages I've been playing around with. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, but I think every one of these deserves some attention.

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
- [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)
